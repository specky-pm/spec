# component.md Specification

The `component.md` file is the core of the Specky component specification. While the `spec.json` file contains metadata, the `component.md` file contains the actual functional requirements and detailed description of the component.

## Purpose

- Describes what the component should do
- Defines functional requirements in a language-agnostic way
- Provides enough detail for developers to implement the component
- Written in a way that LLMs (Large Language Models) can understand and process

## Structure

The `component.md` file is a Markdown document with a specific structure. It typically includes the following sections:

### Required Sections

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Component Name | A clear, descriptive title that matches the component name in `spec.json`. |
| Overview | A concise summary of what the component does and its purpose in the system. |
| Core Functionality | Detailed description of the main features and capabilities of the component. |

### Recommended Sections

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| User Interactions | How users interact with the component, including user flows and experience considerations. |
| Data Management | How the component manages data, including what data is stored and how it's processed. |
| Integration Points | How the component interacts with other components or systems. |
| Edge Cases and Error Handling | How the component should handle unusual situations and errors. |
| Constraints and Limitations | Any known constraints or limitations of the component. |
| Examples | Example scenarios to illustrate how the component should be used. |

### Optional Sections

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Glossary | Definitions of key terms used throughout the specification. |
| Performance Requirements | Any performance expectations for the component. |
| Compliance Requirements | Any regulatory or compliance requirements. |

## Writing Style Guidelines

- **Be Clear and Specific**: Use precise language to describe functionality.
- **Focus on What, Not How**: Describe what the component should do, not how it should be implemented.
- **Use Consistent Terminology**: Maintain consistent terms throughout the document.
- **Use Active Voice**: Write in active voice for clarity.
- **Organize Hierarchically**: Use headings and subheadings to create a clear structure.

# User Authentication Component

## Overview

The User Authentication Component handles all aspects of user authentication including registration, login, logout, password management, and session handling. It provides secure, reliable authentication services that can be integrated with any application requiring user identity verification.

## Core Functionality

### User Registration
- Collect essential user information (email, password, name)
- Validate email format and uniqueness
- Enforce password strength requirements
- Generate and store secure password hashes
- Send verification emails to confirm user identity
- Create new user accounts upon successful verification

### Authentication
- Verify user credentials against stored information
- Generate secure session tokens upon successful authentication
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Support remember-me functionality for persistent sessions
- Track login attempts and lock accounts after suspicious activity

## User Interactions

### Registration Flow
1. User navigates to registration page
2. User enters email, password, and profile information
3. System validates input in real-time
4. User submits registration form
5. System sends verification email
6. User clicks verification link
7. Account is activated and user is directed to login

## Data Management

### User Data
The component stores the following user information:
- Unique identifier
- Email address (unique)
- Password hash (never the plain password)
- Account status (active, pending, locked)
- Registration date
- Last login timestamp
- Failed login attempts

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

### Account Recovery
- Process for recovering access when email is inaccessible
- Handling of accounts with suspicious activity
- Procedure for administratively resetting accounts

## Constraints and Limitations

- Maximum of 10 failed login attempts before temporary lockout
- Password reset links expire after 24 hours
- Email verification required before full account access
- Session tokens valid for maximum of 30 days
